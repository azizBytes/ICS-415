- Object intersection (spheres, planes)
- Ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting
- Recursive reflection
- Camera configuration
- PPM or PNG image output

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Contents

- `Camera.java`: Camera positioning and projection
- `Sphere.java`, `Plane.java`: Scene objects
- `RayTracer.java`: Main ray tracing engine
- `Scene.java`: Holds the world setup

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
2.Run
